        nervous, I'm worried. I went into service when I was quite a little
        girl, and now I'm not used to common life, and my hands are white, white
        as a lady's. I'm so tender and so delicate now; respectable and afraid
        of everything.... I'm so frightened. And I don't know what will happen
        to my nerves if you deceive me, Yasha.</p>

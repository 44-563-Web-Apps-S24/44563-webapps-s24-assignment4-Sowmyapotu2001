            THE CHERRY ORCHARD AND  Anton Chekov
        </h6>
        <h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
        <p>
             [Thoughtfully] </p>
             <P>I haven't a real passport. I don't know how
old I am, and I think I'm young. When I was a little girl my father and
mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and I used
to do the _salto mortale_ and various little things. And when papa and
mamma died a German lady took me to her and began to teach me. I liked
it. I grew up and became a governess. And where I came from and who
I am, I don't know.... Who my parents were--perhaps they weren't
married--I don't know. [Takes a cucumber out of her pocket and eats] I
don't know anything. [Pause] I do want to talk, but I haven't anybody to
talk to... I haven't anybody at all.</p>

<h6>EPIKHODOV.</h6>
<p> [Plays on the guitar and sings]</p>
<P>
   "What is this noisy earth to me,
   What matter friends and foes?"
   I do like playing on the mandoline!</p>

<h6>DUNYASHA.</h6>
<p>That's a guitar, not a mandoline. [Looks at herself in a
little mirror and powders herself.]</p>
<h6>EPIKHODOV.</h6>
<p> For the enamoured madman, this is a mandoline.<P> [Sings]</P>

   "Oh that the heart was warmed,
   By all the flames of love returned!"</p>

<p>[YASHA sings too.]</p>
<h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
<p> These people sing terribly.... Foo! Like jackals.</p>
<h6>DUNYASHA.</h6>
<p> [To YASHA] </p><P>Still, it must be nice to live abroad.</p>
<h6>YASHA. </h6>
<p>Yes, certainly. I cannot differ from you there. </p>
<P>[Yawns and lights
a cigar.]</p>
<h6>EPIKHODOV. </h6>
<p>That is perfectly natural. Abroad everything is in full
complexity.</p>
<h6>YASHA.</h6>
<p> That goes without saying.</p>
<h6>EPIKHODOV.</h6>
<p> I'm an educated man, I read various remarkable books, but I
cannot understand the direction I myself want to go--whether to live
or to shoot myself, as it were. So, in case, I always carry a revolver
about with me. Here it is. </p><P>[Shows a revolver.]</p>
<h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
<p> I've done. Now I'll go. <P>[Slings the rifle]</P> You, Epikhodov,
are a very clever man and very terrible; women must be madly in love
with you. Brrr! [Going] These wise ones are all so stupid. I've nobody
to talk to. I'm always alone, alone; I've nobody at all... and I don't
know who I am or why I live. [Exit slowly.]</p>
<h6>EPIKHODOV.</h6>
<p> As a matter of fact, independently of everything else, I must
express my feeling, among other things, that fate has been as pitiless
in her dealings with me as a storm is to a small ship. Suppose, let
us grant, I am wrong; then why did I wake up this morning, to give an
example, and behold an enormous spider on my chest, like that. [Shows
with both hands] And if I do drink some kvass, why is it that there is
bound to be something of the most indelicate nature in it, such as a
beetle? </p><P>[Pause] </P>Have you read Buckle? <P>[Pause]</P><P> I should like to trouble
you, Avdotya Fedorovna, for two words.</p>
<h6>DUNYASHA.</h6>
<p> Say on.</p>
<h6>EPIKHODOV.</h6>
<p>I should prefer to be alone with you. </p><P>[Sighs.]</p>
<h6>UNYASHA.</h6>
<p> [Shy] </p><P>Very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... It's
by the cupboard. It's a little damp here.</p>
<h6>EPIKHODOV.</h6>
<p> Very well... I'll bring it.... Now I know what to do with my
revolver. </p><P>[Takes guitar and exits, strumming.]</p>

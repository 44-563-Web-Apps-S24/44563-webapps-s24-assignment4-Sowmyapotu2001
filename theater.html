            CHARLOTTA. [Thoughtfully] I haven't a real passport. I don't know how
old I am, and I think I'm young. When I was a little girl my father and
mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and I used
to do the _salto mortale_ and various little things. And when papa and
mamma died a German lady took me to her and began to teach me. I liked
it. I grew up and became a governess. And where I came from and who
I am, I don't know.... Who my parents were--perhaps they weren't
married--I don't know. [Takes a cucumber out of her pocket and eats] I
don't know anything. [Pause] I do want to talk, but I haven't anybody to
talk to... I haven't anybody at all.</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. [Plays on the guitar and sings]

   "What is this noisy earth to me,
   What matter friends and foes?"
   I do like playing on the mandoline!</p>

<p>DUNYASHA. That's a guitar, not a mandoline. [Looks at herself in a
little mirror and powders herself.]</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. For the enamoured madman, this is a mandoline. [Sings]

   "Oh that the heart was warmed,
   By all the flames of love returned!"</p>

<p>[YASHA sings too.]</p>

<p>CHARLOTTA. These people sing terribly.... Foo! Like jackals.</p>

<p>DUNYASHA. [To YASHA] Still, it must be nice to live abroad.</p>

<p>YASHA. Yes, certainly. I cannot differ from you there. [Yawns and lights
a cigar.]</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. That is perfectly natural. Abroad everything is in full
complexity.</p>

<p>YASHA. That goes without saying.</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. I'm an educated man, I read various remarkable books, but I
cannot understand the direction I myself want to go--whether to live
or to shoot myself, as it were. So, in case, I always carry a revolver
about with me. Here it is. [Shows a revolver.]</p>

<p>CHARLOTTA. I've done. Now I'll go. [Slings the rifle] You, Epikhodov,
are a very clever man and very terrible; women must be madly in love
with you. Brrr! [Going] These wise ones are all so stupid. I've nobody
to talk to. I'm always alone, alone; I've nobody at all... and I don't
know who I am or why I live. [Exit slowly.]</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. As a matter of fact, independently of everything else, I must
express my feeling, among other things, that fate has been as pitiless
in her dealings with me as a storm is to a small ship. Suppose, let
us grant, I am wrong; then why did I wake up this morning, to give an
example, and behold an enormous spider on my chest, like that. [Shows
with both hands] And if I do drink some kvass, why is it that there is
bound to be something of the most indelicate nature in it, such as a
beetle? [Pause] Have you read Buckle? [Pause] I should like to trouble
you, Avdotya Fedorovna, for two words.</p>

<p>DUNYASHA. Say on.</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. I should prefer to be alone with you. [Sighs.]</p>

<p>UNYASHA. [Shy] Very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... It's
by the cupboard. It's a little damp here.</p>

<p>EPIKHODOV. Very well... I'll bring it.... Now I know what to do with my
revolver. [Takes guitar and exits, strumming.]</p>
